# Default Credit Card

The objective of this project is to tackle a machine learning classification problem that involves identifying the reasons why users default on their loan and credit card payments. Multiple algorithms will be evaluated, and the optimal one will be selected. The ultimate aim is to determine the most effective threshold for categorizing each user and maximize profits according to predefined business rules.
